# Black Hat AI  
Offensive Techniques for Breaking and Bending Machine Minds

This is not a safe book.  
This is a red team field manual for exploiting AI systems — fast, focused, and free.

**Black Hat AI** explores how large language models (LLMs) can be manipulated, hijacked, or broken through language alone.  
No reverse engineering. No shellcode. Just precision-crafted input.
