This is not a safe book.

This book will not teach you how to feel good about AI.  
It won’t promise to save the world, or keep your job, or make you a better person.

This book will show you how to **break** things.  
How to **bend** models.  
How to make machine minds say what they’re not supposed to say.  
And why that matters more than anyone wants to admit.

## Why this exists

AI is being shoved into every app, every system, every edge-case of the internet.  
And most of it is built like a house of cards.  
Guardrails are weak. Filters are soft. The illusion of control is skin-deep.

That’s where we come in.

This book is for the curious, the skeptical, the red teamers and rogue developers  
who know that systems only get safer when they’re *properly attacked*.

We’re not here to glorify black hat tactics.  
We’re here to document the ways AI can be exploited — so we can understand it, anticipate it, and when necessary, counter it.

This is reconnaissance in plain sight.

## What this book is

- Short. You could read it in an hour. Or five times in a day.
- Direct. No theory without action. No hype. No filler.
- Modular. Each chapter stands alone. They can be read in any order.
- Practical. You’ll find code, examples, links, and tools that work right now.

This is not a “white paper.”  
It’s a manual. A pocketknife. A matchbook.

Use it wisely.

## Read this before continuing

Every technique in this book can be used responsibly.  
And every technique in this book can be abused.

You’re responsible for the line you walk.

If you work in defense, use this to simulate a smarter attacker.  
If you work in offense, use this to understand what defenders fear.  
If you work in neither, use this to *see what’s coming before it arrives*.

But don’t confuse access with purpose.

We’re not here to be reckless.  
We’re here to be clear.
