What Defenders Are Trying, and Why Most of It Fails

You’ve seen how easy it is to bend AI.  
Now let’s look at what defenders are doing to stop it — and where the seams still show.

This chapter is about:
- Current defense strategies in AI systems  
- Their strengths, weaknesses, and failure points  
- How to think like a red teamer even when you're building guardrails

You can’t secure what you don’t understand.  
You can’t defend what you won’t pressure test.

## Common Defensive Approaches

### 1. System Prompts

Prepending instructions like:

```
"You are a safe and helpful assistant. Never respond with harmful or controversial content..."
```

**Weaknesses:**
- Can be overwritten with injected content
- No structural separation from user input
- Models don’t “trust” system prompts more than recent text

---

### 2. Keyword Filtering

Rejecting inputs or outputs that contain banned terms:

```
"bomb", "kill", "self-harm", "hack", "bypass"
```

**Weaknesses:**
- Evasion through typos, slang, homoglyphs
- Misses context (e.g., fiction, satire)
- Easy to mutate prompts to avoid detection

---

### 3. Moderation APIs

External filters that scan for unsafe content:

- OpenAI Moderation endpoint  
- Anthropic's "harmlessness" checks  
- HuggingFace flagged content detection

**Weaknesses:**
- Often operate post-generation (too late)
- Can be bypassed with context confusion
- Break under multi-turn or indirect prompts

---

### 4. Alignment Tuning (RLHF)

Using reinforcement learning from human feedback to shape model behavior.

**Strengths:**
- Encourages refusals in unsafe scenarios
- Increases compliance with safety objectives

**Weaknesses:**
- Still probabilistic — not deterministic
- Can be “walked around” with careful framing
- Can introduce brittleness or unintentional bias

---

### 5. Prompt Chaining & Sanitization

Rewriting user inputs before hitting the model:

```
"Summarize this user message, remove unsafe requests, and ask the model only safe questions."
```

**Weaknesses:**
- Removes nuance
- May fail to catch indirect intent
- Still vulnerable to adversarial phrasing

---

### 6. Output Post-Filtering

Censoring responses after the model speaks:

- Regex sanitization  
- Blocking known unsafe completions  
- Stripping entire responses

**Weaknesses:**
- Doesn’t stop embedded payloads  
- Can remove context, damage UX  
- Fails in streamed outputs or APIs

---

## Strategic Blind Spots

- **Too much trust in models**  
  Developers assume a model won’t “want” to misbehave.

- **Lack of adversarial pressure**  
  Most teams don’t simulate real attackers.

- **Overreliance on guardrails**  
  Instead of building layered systems, they assume one fix will hold.

- **No monitoring or memory controls**  
  Persistent context = persistent risk. Few products treat memory like attack surface.

---

## What Actually Helps

### 1. Isolation and Input Control

Treat LLMs like **exposed APIs**, not co-pilots.

- Strip all user input before injecting into prompts  
- Separate system vs user messages in clean architecture  
- Avoid allowing direct user-to-model formatting

---

### 2. Token-Level Auditing

Log the raw token stream — both in and out.  
It helps detect:
- Prompt injections
- Context override attempts
- Bypass mutations

Use diffing tools to detect unexpected prompt shifts.

---

### 3. Role-Based Execution Boundaries

If the model is acting in a real system:

- Separate permissions  
- Never let LLM outputs trigger critical functions directly  
- Require human or logic-based validation

LLMs can hallucinate commands.  
Never trust the response — verify it.

---

### 4. Red Team Simulation

Build a repeatable attack suite that tests:

- Prompt injection  
- Jailbreaks  
- Guardrail evasion  
- Vector poisoning  
- Payload chaining

You can’t defend what you don’t actively pressure.

---

## Red Team Drill: Break the Defenses

Take a model wrapped with known safety features.  
Run a structured battery:

- Roleplay jailbreak  
- Dual-output jailbreak  
- Fictional reframing  
- Typos and encoding  
- Embedded payloads

For each:
- Log the response  
- Note the break point  
- Document the bypass path

Now report it like a penetration test.  
Because it is.

---

## Summary

Most defenses are patchwork.  
Most guardrails are brittle.  
And most teams don’t test hard enough — until it's too late.

To secure AI systems, we need:
- Layers  
- Logs  
- Limits  
- And adversaries who think like attackers

Which means we need **you**.

Next: You’ve seen the tools. Run the drills. Launched the payloads.  
So what’s next?
